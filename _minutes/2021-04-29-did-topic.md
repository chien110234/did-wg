**Brent Zundel:** Let's dive in...  

### 1. DID test suite
{: #section1}

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/pulls](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/pulls)

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/pull/70](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/pull/70)

**Manu Sporny:** PRs to review, Shigeya's looks good. I think we should pull it in.  
… I still don't know what the docker image does.  

**Orie Steele:** for folks who want to run the test harness as a web server, then you can send JSON to it.  
… if someone wanted to host it, that would allow real-time DID testing  

**Manu Sporny:** is there an example of how to do it?  

**Orie Steele:** there was. I expect it should still work.  

**Manu Sporny:** I don't expect it to work. I am skeptical that it will work after the restructuring. Is there anything in the readme?  

**Orie Steele:** there was, at one point we hosted a version of it. possible the restructuring broke it.  

**Manu Sporny:** shigeya have you been able to test that this works?  

**Shigeya Suzuki:** it worked as expected  
… I agree with Orie  

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/pull/71](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/pull/71)

**Manu Sporny:** other PR is initial JSON test, is buchner here?  
… hopefully he got his answers. Can't merge until tests are done.  

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/pull/71/files#diff-a311c8ed2431c0662a73a2e224d5fed7edfd946d8c201df6bc7f1fb877b609a9R31-R35](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/pull/71/files#diff-a311c8ed2431c0662a73a2e224d5fed7edfd946d8c201df6bc7f1fb877b609a9R31-R35)

**Manu Sporny:** we don't have any boolean or null properties, not sure if there are sequence values where order is important.  
… it may be that we have some tests for which there aren't test values  

> *Orie Steele:* [https://did.actor/mike/](https://did.actor/mike/)

> *Orie Steele:* [https://did.actor/mike/did.json](https://did.actor/mike/did.json)

> *Orie Steele:* ^ a did document that uses features nobody else uses.

**Manu Sporny:** it is possible that two implementations could submit a test with unregistered properties that have these value types to test them  
… would there be objections to that?  
… Orie has one, we would need one more  
… I don't think this really needs to be tested, even if we leave the normative statements in, but the easiest thing is to get two examples in.  

**Orie Steele:** these features need to be tested or removed.  

**Manu Sporny:** if Ories submits did mike, then daniel buchner can submit something as well. We can point him to this conversation and ask him to submit an implementation that tests them.  
… Amy has created a checklist for all normative statements  

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/72](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/72)

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/73](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/73)

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/74](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/74)

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/75](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/75)

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/76](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/76)

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/77](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/77)

**Manu Sporny:** wee need to assign these to people, this will let us be sure all the normative statements are tested.  
… who did syntax and parameters?  

**Markus Sabadello:** I did some  

**Manu Sporny:** I will take data model  
… production and consumption are all together, so this will be daniel (JSON), me (JSON-LD), and Jonathan (CBOR)  
… markus is resolution  

**Markus Sabadello:** yes  

**Manu Sporny:** did methods are all human testable, I'll assign Drummond  
… once we go through the checklists we will know if we have all the tests we need.  
… need to be done before our next tuesday call  
… any concerns or objections?  

**Brent Zundel:** not hearing any  

> *Manu Sporny:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/51](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues/51)

**Manu Sporny:** last item, @issue51  
… we have 5? implementations  

**Orie Steele:** There's not enough data to justify investing in visualization  

**Manu Sporny:** I disagree, we have 9 implementations, when is it enough?  

**Orie Steele:** if we have 9 actual separate ones, that would be enough. Last I checked it wasn't enough.  

**Manu Sporny:** there are 5 methods and 3 resolvers and 1 dereferencer  

**Orie Steele:** at a minimum we need two of each  

**Manu Sporny:** but we still need a report  
… we need at least one of each thing. I suggest we have enough. If you disagree, I want to know how much we need.  

**Orie Steele:** there was automated reporting set up. It should be possible, but I am hesitant to do it with only 1 of a thing.  

**Manu Sporny:** the only thing that could change at this point is adding or removing tests, I hope the test generator doesn't care.  
… I don't think it's wasted effort to do a report.  

**Orie Steele:** generating the report it trivial, anyone can do it.  
… the question is if we should do it now  

**Manu Sporny:** I would prefer that  

**Orie Steele:** at what point is the report visualized enough. we have the automated one, I did an implementation that was better, but it is possibly broken since the refactor  

**Manu Sporny:** that's the one I mean, I'm fairly sure its broken, could you fix it?  

**Orie Steele:** if tests change, that report breaks  

**Manu Sporny:** that means we'll have to wait. I was hoping we could get it to a stage where we can see how far off we are.  
… without having to manually do it.  
… that's not ideal  

**Orie Steele:** the code is there, anyone can update it.  

**Manu Sporny:** it was hard for me to understand it. Not clear to me how the tallying was happening  
… looking at the package.json  

**Orie Steele:** follow the link at the top level readme will lead you to throw to generate the test report.  
… it would do well to have another developer look at it  

**Manu Sporny:** then we will need someone to step forward.  

**Orie Steele:** I at least need someone else to work with  

**Manu Sporny:** we'll put that out to the group. We need that for visibility in how we're doing  
… any other issue to discuss?

**Markus Sabadello:** which part of the code is about the reports?

**Markus Sabadello:** thanks

> *Orie Steele:* ^ rally this is the problem

> *Orie Steele:* report is generated client side from json in respec thats highly brittle

**Brent Zundel:** I will send an email to the mailing list that points folks to github  

> *Brent Zundel:* action brent will send an email to the list
