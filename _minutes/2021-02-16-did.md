**Brent Zundel:** Agenda review: details about special topic call, notice about deferred issues, tests, process for Notes, and then a review of subtantive PRs  

### 1. special topic call
{: #section1}

**Brent Zundel:** skipping intros/reintros  
… special topic call is today at 6PM EST  
… the topic will be a working session on PRs  

### 2. notice to the group deferred issues
{: #section2}

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adefer-v2](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adefer-v2)

**Brent Zundel:** notice to the WG: a number of issues are labeled as "Deferred"  
… these are all issues being deferred to a future version of the spec  

### 3. writing tests
{: #section3}

**Brent Zundel:** we have a test suite due to the labors of a very few number of contributors  
… now is the time for others to volunteer and contribute  

**Manu Sporny:** I would prefer if we got concrete commitments for specific tests for specific sections of the spec  
… the [spec](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) is fairly stable, so the expectation is that you as an implementer would commit to write the tests for a specific section  
… that includes all normative MUST statements in that section  
… it would also be good for WG members to note that you plan to implement those tests  
… please only volunteer if you fully intend to implement  
… this helps identify anything that may be at risk  

> *Markus Sabadello:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues](https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/issues)

**Markus Sabadello:** We have been keeping track of who has been saying they will commit to what tests  

**Brent Zundel:** For example, Transmute has made certain commitments and so has Digital Bazaar  
… also, this helps us know who is planning to implement what sections, and what we might need to mark at risk  

**Manu Sporny:** ideally we would be tracking these in one issue  
… Manu would be like to get that we need to get volunteers for the other sections  
… so it's very important that other member companies step up  

> *Daniel Buchner:* I have tests for the equiv sections, Manu

> *Daniel Buchner:* Because I know how much you like it ;)

**Brent Zundel:** The test suite is how we measure multiple implementations. Without it we won't exit CR  

### 4. call for implementations
{: #section4}

**Brent Zundel:** This is the official call for implementations  
… this is the time to implement  
… the way to do that is via commitments to the test suite  
… we also want to get commitments to DID usage  
… there are a number of different DID methods and usages in the wild—reporting those is also very helpful  

**Phil Archer:** GS1 is planning to implement. Starting a 120 day program to do that. What's the timeline for completing implementation reports?  

**Manu Sporny:** In theory we go into CR roughly the beginning of March. The shortest period is 60 days to get a first round of feedback. Then typically there will be a second round.  
… so that timeframe should line up.  

**Phil Archer:** Yes, that should work  

**Brent Zundel:** I second that timeline  

> *Orie Steele:* Where is the latest list of normative statements?

**Wayne Chang:** My company continues to commit to test suite conformance.  
… We very much want support for tests in the earliest time frame possible  

> *Wayne Chang:* our repo: [https://github.com/spruceid/didkit](https://github.com/spruceid/didkit)

**Daniel Buchner:** Microsoft is ready to go into production, and willing to be part of testing and reporting on pieces of the implementations that we've done  

> *Orie Steele:* our repo: [https://github.com/transmute-industries/did-core](https://github.com/transmute-industries/did-core)

**Brent Zundel:** Thank you, we look forward to your contributions to the test suite  

> *Markus Sabadello:* DIF Universal Resolver with support for ~40 DID methods: [https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver)

### 5. note publication process
{: #section5}

**Brent Zundel:** We have a number of Notes in process  
… as the editors of those Notes near completion, they should contact the editors  
… then the authors should contact the chairs  
… when the chairs believe the note is ready as a final version, they will provide a one-week notice to the WG  
… after which the note will be published  
… reminder: a Note does not need to reflect the consensus of the group  

### 6. substantive PR-s
{: #section6}

> *Brent Zundel:* [https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Asubstantive](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Asubstantive)

**Brent Zundel:** There are 3 substantive PRs to review today  
… these 3 PRs make substantive changes that either add or change normative text  
… so we want to be sure they have consensus  
… if you disagree with anything about these, please make constructive feedback  

**Manu Sporny:** There have been a flurry of PRs as part of the editors making a final editorial pass  
… everything through sections 1 to 5 have had a pass and are fairly stable  
… section 6 - the representation section - should be done this week  
… so close review of the first 5 sections is recommended  
… .the resolution section is still being reviewed/discussed  

#### 6.1. resolution testing 
{: #section6-1}

_See github pull request [#644](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/644)._

<!-- issue w3c/did-core/644 -->



**Manu Sporny:** one issue with the resolution section is that it is abstract so we are still trying to figure out how to make it concrete enough to test  
… one approach is to say that the metadata structure that represents the abstract data model can be serialized so that it can then be translated into various representations  
… in order to do that we are suggesting a change to the abstract data model  
… up to this point it has only been about DID documents  
… but we are now considering making the abstract data model can represent other data structures that may be needed to create a specific representation  
… and then you can use the representation production rules in order to create a concrete representation  
… Markus and Justin have expressed some reservations about this  
… so we are open to discussing it  

**Markus Sabadello:** I understand the motivation to make things more testable...  
… but the intention was to make the DID resolution section abstract because concrete resolution protocols were out of scope  
… so it can be confusing to say that the abstract data model can be used for other things besides DID documents  
… so Markus would prefer that the abstract data model stays focused on DID documents and not include metadata structures  
… since metadata structures are "really something else"  

**Brent Zundel:** We have repeatedly used "testable" to be machine testable. However "testable" does not have to mean machine-testable.  

**Justin Richer:** What concerns me about this proposal is that it is "leaking requirements" of the test suite into the specification  
… not all of the requirements of the test suite need to be represented in the spec  
… for example, in the resolution spec we agreed to define "contracts"  
… that does not mean that the core specification needs to go into this level of detailing  
… and it does not mean the spec needs to change its nature to fit the needs of an implementation  
… this is dangerous and backwards  

**Markus Sabadello:** In the section on metadata structures, we defined them the same way as the abstract data model where we use Infra and data maps  
… so we do have examples for how this abstract data structure that could be represented in JSON  
… so we could add some examples that show how the abstract data model can be made machine testable  

**Brent Zundel:** Roughly the two approaches are either we need to describe how to make concrete the abstract parts of the spec in order to make them machine-testable...  
… or we alter the test suite in order to machine-test those statements  

**Manu Sporny:** The issue we are in is that the group defined resolution in the abstract...  
… but when the language was written for the resolution section, we used a whole bunch of normative MUST statements  
… then we decided that we should have machine-testing of normative MUST statements  
… so now we have a resolution section that needs testing  
… so why don't we focus on the actual language of the PRs  
… there are two proposals: make the normative statements testable OR  
… put the logic for testing into the test suite and say that is good enough  
… we need more input from the WG about which direction we should go  
… and see what specific language we can agree on  
… for example, Markus suggests that we can provide examples of how the abstract data model can be serialized  

**Brent Zundel:** Let's move in the direction of looking at the PR text  

> *Orie Steele:* where is the list of normative requirements.

**Jonathan Holt:** Adding this detail this late in the game is not a good idea - it can be handled in the DID Spec Registries  
… I added an example for CBOR that uses date time stamps using vanilla CBOR  
… so I added that detail to DID Spec Registries instead  

**Markus Sabadello:** We should really look at the concrete impacts. I think this is a big change.  
… I understand the motivations, but I consider the metadata to be very different than the DID document data  
… so keeping the abstract data model focused on the DID document is more precise  
… it is not helpful to use the abstract data model for metadata  
… we defined the abstract data model for DID documents, not for other metadata  

> *Orie Steele:* why is the type of did document an infra map... if its not an infra map?

**Markus Sabadello:** the metadata has some similarities, but it will be handled differently than the DID document data  

> *Justin Richer:* +1 to markus_sabadello

**Markus Sabadello:** my proposal is to expand the examples of what the metadata would look like in JSON  
… and then make it testable in the test suite  

**Manu Sporny:** I would like people to look at [the text that is under debate](https://github.com/w3c/did-core/pull/644/files). WG members should read the PR.  
… I disagree with what the abstract data model is supposed to do.  
… it should apply to everything in the specification  
… so from my perspective, the ADM was supposed to be for any data structure specified in DID Core  
… for those who are saying that the ADM should not apply, I'd like to know why we are "creating this other world" that needs to be respecified in the same way we define the ADM  
… but we may just want to move on to other PRs at this point as we need the rest of the WG to engage on this issue  
… but not deciding about this issue is going to slow down finishing this section  

> *Justin Richer:* to me, the ADM was _always_ meant to be _only_ for DID Documents. that we use the same definitions for _other_ data structures don't mean they're the same

**Brent Zundel:** Note that the special topic call today will be a continuation of this discussion  

**Ivan Herman:** Taking it to a higher level: originally the goal of resolution was defining a contract  
… regardless of whether INFRA can be used to define these contracts, we must ultimately make these contracts machine-testable  
… so it has come up several times in the past few weeks which relies on human reports of implementability  

> *Justin Richer:* +1 to ivan

**Ivan Herman:** and whether going to one extreme is the basis of the disagreement  

**Manu Sporny:** I worry that we are speaking out of both sides of our mouth  
… we should either agree that we're not doing machine testability of the resolution section  

> *Justin Richer:* -1

> *Amy Guy:* +1 DID resolution in a Note

> *Orie Steele:* -1 to removing resolution... its 99% of what the spec is about...

> *Justin Richer:* ORie: that's why it got added in a year ago, it doesn't make sense to talk about DIDs and Documents w/o talking about what's in between

**Drummond Reed:** It feels like if we lock in on what the requirements in the spec are for the contract  
… and if we say the contract is abstract, then maybe the way to test it can be described in the test suite  

> *Justin Richer:* +1 to drummond

**Ivan Herman:** +1 to what Drummond said - in addition, the presentation of things whereby having a normative statement must be backed up my machine-testing is not a requirement  
… it is okay to have a normative statement that is not directly machine-testable  
… we should be more liberal in that respect  

**Joe Andrieu:** I think the interpreted rule that all normative statements much be machine-testable is too restrictive  
… the definition of a contract is that it will say what you must do, and whether or not it is machine-testable is a different issue  

> *Daniel Buchner:* I strongly agree with Joe

> *Daniel Buchner:* Folks, JOE AND I STRONGLY AGREE

> *Daniel Buchner:* this means it is the right thing, obviously

**Markus Sabadello:** Based on what others are saying here, I want to ask: is it acceptable to have normative statements in the spec that are not directly machine testable without additional information...  
… but that additional information is readily available in some additional documents  

> *Brent Zundel:* +1 to Markus

**Markus Sabadello:** for example in other protocol specification documents in the W3C Credentials Community Group or at the Decentralized Identity Foundation  

**Manu Sporny:** I'm confused now as to whether we are testing DID resolution or not  
… some are staying that we shouldn't test it at all, vs. testing with some additional info that's not in the spec  
… I have been operating under the assumption that because there are so many normative statements in the resolution section, that we should make it all machine testable  

**Ivan Herman:** First, to answer to Markus, I'm not sure I fully understand the question  
… the implementation of the resolution contract should not depend on another spec or document  
… the #1 question is whether the contract is fulfilled or not  
… to reply to Manu, my view is that we have a contract definition. We can define "tests" that, for specific data, this is how the contract can be fulfilled and this is the response it should return  
… but whether or not that is machine-testable is not required  
… if it is machine-testable, that is good, but not required  

**Daniel Buchner:** There are 3 classes of testability. 1) 100% testable via a local DID document. Fully deterministic.  
… 2) the class of untestable language, such as "you must not use data describing a human"  

> *Justin Richer:* +1 to the coupling idea, that's what I've been saying all along

> *Markus Sabadello:* Can't we use this in the test suite? [https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/#did-resolution-result](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/#did-resolution-result)

**Orie Steele:** I spent some time trying to implement the abstract data model this weekend and I'm starting to agree with some of what Justin and Markus are saying  
… there is a class of tests that are not valuable to use as spec authors  
… there probably needs to be a way to test what is in the spec without talking about a specific implementation  
… this is challenging because it requires some concrete implementation of the ADM in the test suite  
… anyone who says that we should not test testable statements as long as there is some way to test them is harming the spec  
… the ADM is testable, but what's hard is that the language around the ADM how to interpret it  
… for example, if production works directly from the ADM, or does it take additional arguments  
… so we have a problem here. There are people talking past each other.  
… the solution is to gain clarity around the function signatures for the processes defined in the spec  

> *Markus Sabadello:* +1 to Orie that production is too vague right now

**Orie Steele:** then writing tests will be much easier  

> *Jonathan Holt:* Orie: +1, that was extremely well stated!

> *Daniel Buchner:* We should test certain things with a default set of functions that implementers can put their own function bodies into them

> *Manu Sporny:* Yes, +1 to Orie, that's the problem.

> *Daniel Buchner:* for ex: you can test against in-mem default values, but allow devs to replace the function with their own DB fetch function to get the same values

> *Daniel Buchner:* that's still a deterministic test

**Brent Zundel:** This will be continued on the special topic call today. Please come.  

**Ivan Herman:** I will not be able to be there.  

**Brent Zundel:** PR 644 is where we need to focus. Please do come to that call.
