### What is going on?

The [W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/)
had [consensus](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2021-07-20-did#resolution1) to
propose publication of [DID Core 1.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) as a W3C Proposed Recommendation 
(basically, a global Web standard). There were 
[40 W3C Member companies](https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/did-core-pr/results) that 
agreed to publication of DID Core 1.0 as a W3C Recommendation and there were 
3 companies that objected: Google, Apple, and Mozilla. The W3C Team stepped 
in to [mediate a discussion](https://www.w3.org/2021/09/21-did10-minutes.html) 
that did not resolve the formal objections.

The acting W3C Director then decided to 
[request feedback from the W3C Council](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/Meetings/Minutes/2021-10-05-did#section2), 
which is composed of the W3C Advisory Board and the W3C Technical
Architecture Group, and take the new W3C Council Formal Objection resolution
process for a spin. The Decentralized Identifier Working Group is deeply
frustrated by this recent turn of events, but understands that someone needs
to be the first through this new process.

There are four aspects of how this is playing out that are deeply concerning:

1. The objectors (Google, Apple, and Mozilla), and the proponents (over 40
companies) collectively hold 7 out of the 21 seats on the W3C Council. This
enables 1/3rd of the W3C Council who are taking a position on the formal
objection to engage in what is supposed to be an impartial process.

2. The new W3C Council Formal Objection Process gently suggests that
individuals that might have a conflict of interest can voluntarily recuse
themselves; the decision is left up to the individual. Apple has raised a
formal objection and sits on both the W3C AB and W3C TAG; are both individuals
expected to recuse themselves? The hope is that the answer to this question is "Yes,
because the formal objection is on behalf of Apple and therefore, there is a
conflict of interest." The same recusal issue applies to Google's representatives.

3. The W3C Team, who have a long and positive track record of striking the
right balance when providing input into these sorts of decisions, have been
stripped of any decision making authority.

4. Lastly, Google, Apple, and Mozilla made no attempt to bring their formal
objections to the Decentralized Identifier Working Group since the Working
Group started, and then during the first transition to Candidate
Recommendation and then during the second transition to Candidate
Recommendation. The first time the group heard of these objections during its
two-year charter was in the days before the poll closed to approve DID Core
1.0 as a W3C Recommendation.

That is, in a nutshell, what is going on.

### Why the concern over 3 companies objecting?

The concern is that Google, Apple, and Mozilla are objecting and then 
get to be on the W3C Council that determines whether or not the objection
is valid. That is, these three companies have a non-trivial influence
on overriding what 40 companies have found consensus to standardize 
at W3C. There are concerns around some of the biggest tech companies
on the planet being able to stop global standards that would open 
their businesses up to more competition.

Google and Apple are two of the largest identity providers on the planet.
Google Accounts, Apple ID, Sign in with Google, and Sign in with Apple are a
few of the products and services that could be viewed as competing with the
W3C Decentralized Identifiers specification.

Speaking more broadly, Google Wallet, Apple Wallet, and initiatives such as
Apple's integration of Mobile Driver's Licenses into an ecosystem that does
not allow open competition is also problematic:

[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-announces-first-states-to-adopt-drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-in-wallet/](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-announces-first-states-to-adopt-drivers-licenses-and-state-ids-in-wallet/)

There is a belief that some of these systems are not in the best interest of the
general public. Here is a statement from the Technical Director of the DHS 
Silicon Valley Innovation Program commenting on why the approach taken with 
some of these closed Digital Wallet ecosystems is problematic:

[https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Oct/0005.html](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Oct/0005.html)

The W3C Decentralized Identifier WG, W3C Verifiable Credentials WG, and the
Credentials Community Group are working on open wallet ecosystems. Yet another
class of products and services that could be viewed as competitive.

There is concern over the individuals that work for these corporations
being biased in some way by the competing
technologies and services that their companies are producing. While 
these individuals are believed to be unbiased by some and are not 
expected to just tow tow the company line... it's not appropriate for them 
to be a part of the decision making process for their company's formal 
objections because it raises doubt over the fairness of the W3C Council 
Formal Objection process. That's the more damaging thing to W3C as a community; 
accidentally fomenting distrust in the process. We're already starting to see the
first well-written opinion pieces hit the media outlets on this concern:

[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/01/is-mozilla-trying-to-sabotage-distributed-identity/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/01/is-mozilla-trying-to-sabotage-distributed-identity/)

[https://www.coincenter.org/open-blockchains-and-decentralized-identity-standards/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/01/is-mozilla-trying-to-sabotage-distributed-identity/)

It was quite difficult to get many of these "decentralized technology"
companies to W3C and convince them that the browser vendors didn't run the
show at W3C. It took years of concerted effort, and it's exactly this sort of
situation that reassures their fears. Members of the DID Working Group
have received a substantive number of texts and emails since Apple, Google, 
and Mozilla's formal objections, primarily due to the way they were raised 
and how they're being processed.

### How long will this take?

There is no time limit set on when objections are upheld or rejected. It 
is typically  done within a month or two of the formal objections being 
raised, but can drag on for months after that.
