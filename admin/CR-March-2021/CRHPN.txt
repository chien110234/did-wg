Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Candidate Recommendations published for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0.

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/">Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a> has just 
published a Candidate Recommendation for the 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/CR-did-core-20210318/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> document.</p>

<p>
This document defines Decentralized identifiers (DIDs), a new type of identifier that enables 
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, 
thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies. 
In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled 
from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities.  DIDs are URIs that 
associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that
subject. Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services, 
which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID. 
</p>

<p>Candidate Recommendation means that the Working Group considers the technical design to be complete, 
and is seeking implementation feedback on the document. The group is keen to get 
comments and implementation experiences on this specification as issues raised in the 
documentsâ€™ <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/">Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>The group expects to satisfy the implementation goals (i.e., at least two, independent
implementations for each of the test cases) by April 18, 2021.</p>
