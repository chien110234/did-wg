Abstract

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, 
decentralized digital identity. A DID identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, 
thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it 
identifies. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that 
they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate 
authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery 
of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller of a DID to prove control 
over it without requiring permission from any other party. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID 
subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.

Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or services, 
which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID. 
Services enable trusted interactions associated with the DID subject. A DID might provide 
the means to return the DID subject itself, if the DID subject is an information resource 
such as a data model.

This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties, serialized 
representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process of resolving DIDs to 
the resources that they represent.
